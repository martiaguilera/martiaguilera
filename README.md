ðŸš€ Aspiring Developer & Tech Enthusiast
Hi! I'm MartÃ­, currently studying a Vocational Training in Microcomputer Systems and Networks (SMX), with the goal of advancing to a Higher Degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM), and eventually pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering.

I'm passionate about IT, programming, and technology as a whole. I'm still exploring whether my path will lead toward cybersecurity or software development â€” I'm in an experimental phase and eager to discover where I fit best.

Always open to collaboration on any kind of project. I'm ambitious, driven, and excited to contribute, learn, and grow in innovative environments.
